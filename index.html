      These are amazing times we live in. Just pat your mouse and keyboard with your paws a few times and you can have an informative, interactive map up on the tubez in no time! Certainly much easier than finding those acorns in the park you were hiding from Jerry!

      Alas, using open source components, the following instructions will get you flying into web-mapping. This exercise assumes a knowledge of HTML and Javascript - but not at all required. This will step through each phase of what you see to the right. Just keep on scrolling down in this panel. If you get lost at anytime just ask for help. Someone will be there to scrape you off the road and get you back on your feet again!

    <h2 id="back">Step -1: Set-up > Backend</h2>
    <p>
      Before we get to mapping, we need to ensure that our project is organized and that we can check our progress in the browser as we add new features.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, create a directory somewhere on you computer where you'll store your project. Perhaps give the folder a descriptive name like "leaflet-squirrels".
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, you'll want to start a local server using the Python module SimpleHTTPServer. If you don't have Python, grab it <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank">here</a>. Version 2.7.x is the one you want. <a href="http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/modules-in-python/how-to-use-simplehttpserver/" target="_blank"><em>Python for Beginners</em></a> has a nice walk-through for starting your server, but you really just need to open Terminal(OSX/Linux)/Command Prompt(Windows), navigate to your project's directory, and input the following command:
    </p>
    <!-- HTML generated using hilite.me -->
    <div style="background: #ffffff; overflow:auto;width:auto;border:solid gray;border-width:.1em .1em .1em .8em;padding:.2em .6em;">
      <pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%">python -m SimpleHTTPServer</pre>
    </div>
    <p>
      Just add the URL below into your browser and you'll be able to see your project as if it were online!
    </p>
    <!-- HTML generated using hilite.me -->
    <div style="background: #ffffff; overflow:auto;width:auto;border:solid gray;border-width:.1em .1em .1em .8em;padding:.2em .6em;">
      <pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%">http://127.0.0.1:8000</pre>
    </div>
    <p>
      If you don't like this approach, no worries. You might be interested in using something like <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a> or <a href="https://neocities.org/" target="blank">Neocities</a> to host your project. The upshot is that your project will be online while you're making it.

    <h2 id="front">Step 0: Set-up > Front End</h2>
    <p>
      Using your text editor, set up a simple HTML file. Call it "index.html." We'll also add the container and some basic styling for our map
    </p>
    <p class="examples">

    <h2 id="data">Data: You can get it!</h2>
    <p>
      When trying to learn a new mapping technology, it can sometimes be easy to get hung up on what to map as an example. Lots of things exist on this planet and that means there are a lot of things that can be mapped. To deal with the data hangup, I've taken the liberty of providing some prepared data for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      January 21st is Squirrel Appreciation Day. This is <a href="http://www.holidayinsights.com/moreholidays/January/squirrelappreciation.htm" target="_blank">according to the internet</a>, so you know it's true! As such, we're going to be doing some mapping with a squirrel them (Take that maptimeBoston rats!). Now, Lexington doesn't collect data about squirrels. In fact, there's not a lot of publicly available data about squirrels. They can be a very withholding species, so I had to get creative. Inspired by Andrew Shears' map of the US broken into breakaway states, I wondered "What if the squirrels took over? What would the newly drawn boundaries of the Squirrel States of America look like?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It's difficult to understand the political psychology of squirrels. If you've ever seen them battle over who gets to be on what side of a tree, you know that territorial demarcation is generally a fluid concept. However, let's suspend reality for a bit and assume that squirrels deal in a post-Westphalian notion of territory (whatever that means!). Using data from the Geographic Name Information System (GNIS), a part of the USGS I found 21 settlements (census designated areas, locales, and populated places) that included the term "squirrel". This data includes latitude and longitude so it can be mapped with minimal clean-up. 
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two main datasets we'll be working with that are derived from this GNIS data. The first one is called ssa-capitals.geojson. This is a point dataset that shows the location of the 21 squirrelly places filtered from that full GNIS dataset. We'll be using them as capitals for our Squirrel States of America (SSA). Check it out <a href="https://github.com/maptimelex/leaflet-squirrels/blob/master/ssa-capitals.geojson" target="_blannk">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second dataset is ssa-states.geojson. This is polygon dataset showing the extent of each squirrel state in the SSA. They are simply Voronoi polygons created in QGIS that were clipped by the boundaries of the the USA.
    </p>
    <a class="embedly-card" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram">Voronoi diagram - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</a>
    <script async src="//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
    <p>
       Check it out <a href="https://github.com/maptimelex/leaflet-squirrels/blob/master/ssa-states.geojson" target="_blank">here</a>.Surely there are other more creative methods for drawing these boundaries. Feel free to create your own. I suggest using a cool tool called <a href="http://geojson.io/" target="_blank">GeoJSON.io</a>.

    <h2 id="base">Tile Basemap</h2>
    <p>
      The second element of this project is the basemap. To keep it simple, we are going to use a service provider rather than build our own server stack. We'll learn more about that in the future, but let's make things easier on ourselves with the help of our friends out west at Stamen Design.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="http://mapstack.stamen.com/" target="_blank">MapStack</a> is an awesome project that will allow us to create some free map tiles using OpenStreetMap. The image filters and effects offer a wide variety of customization. When you're happy with what you've came up with copy/paste the tile url of the image. It's rather long, but required for inserting into our code. For this example our url is
      <!-- HTML generated using hilite.me -->

 <!--    <h2 id="gh-pages">Hosting with GitHub Pages</h2>
    <p>
      GitHub is great resource for code-sharing, development, and storage. An added bonus is the automatic page generator for any repository you create. We will use this for hosting our web-app and storing all of the necessary components. Think of it as your personal set of chubby squirrel cheeks!
    </p>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maptimelex/leaflet-squirrels/master/squirrel-cheeks.jpg" style="width: 75%" class="img-center">
    <p>
    When you store your project there will a be total of 5 files in your repository that that run your app. Once you have enabled your github pages branch, you can delete everything except for the index.html file. It will keep all the code for your app, you can rename it if you like as well. Our <a href="https://github.com/maptimelex/leaflet-squirrels" target="_blank">sample repository</a> demonstrates the set-up for this project.

    <h2 id="leaflet">Step 1: Leaflet...at last!</h2>
    <p>
      Leaflet is the magic behind many of today's web-mapping applications. It provides an extensive library of functions supported by a dedicated team of contributors. We are going to use the <a href="http://leafletjs.com" target="_blank">Leaflet.js</a> library to create our map. Using the documentation from the Leaflet.js website, we are going to start with the most basic components needed for a map. We are going to:
    </p>
    <ol class="lst-lowalph">
      <li>Add Leaflet starter code</li>
      <li>Specify the center lat/long of our starting view</li>
      <li>Add our tile layer URL from MapStack</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="examples">
      <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/maptastik/52aa10fde029aa42e8cd" target="_blank">Example</a> | <a href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/maptastik/52aa10fde029aa42e8cd/raw/0fc5764f5dbeabaa357ec8e9ae4a83f1cc4a2d20/index.html" target="_blank">Code</a>

    <h2 id="ssa-capitals">Step 2: Adding Feature Data > SSA Capitals</h2>
    <p>
      It's cool that we hae our basemap down, but the squirrels want more! Let's add some of the .geojson file we looked at earlier. An added step is using a <a href="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.3.min.js" target="_blank">jQuery</a> library to handle the interaction of our data.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are going to:
    </p> 
      <ol class="lst-lowalph">
        <li>Reference jQuery in the html file's <em>head</em></li>
        <li>Load our data</li>
        <li>Add it to the map</li>
      </ol>
    <p class="examples">

    <h2 id="custom-icon">Step 3: Custom Icon</h2>
    <p>
      Our country has been taken over by egomaniacal squirrels. Would they really be satisfied with DEFAULT icons? We must keep them pleased! Fortunately, Leaflet allows us to use our own icons. <a href="https://github.com/maptimelex/leaflet-squirrels/blob/gh-pages/squirrel-king-icon.png" target="_blank">Here's one that will remind our squirrel overlords that they indeed are the rulers of us all</a>!

    <p id="squeeklaugh">
      <em><strong>Mwahsqueeksqueeksqueeksqueek!!!!</strong></em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Only one step here lets:
    </p>
    <ol class="lst-lowalph">
      <li>Add a new icon</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="examples">

    <h2 id="popup">Step 4: Pop-up Window</h2>
    <p>
      The squirrels' eyes gaze on their underlings, but it'd be nice to know more about these squirrel capitals. Let's add some pop-ups from our data's attributes:
    </p>
    <ol class="lst-lowalph">
      <li>Create the pop-up</li>
      <li>Format the text</li>
      <li>Optionally style with css</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="examples">

    </p>

    <h2 id="ssa-states">Step 5: Adding Feature Data > SSA States</h2>
    <p>
      We have a map of our squirrel capitals, but what about the states? Let's see what areas are under the dominion of each squirrel capital. Adding the states polygons is a similar process to when we added the capitals. We don't have to reference jQuery again. We only have to do that once!
    </p>
    <p>
      We have to:
    </p>
    <ol class="lst-lowalph">
      <li>Load our data</li>
      <li>Add it to the map</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="examples">

    <h2 id="custom-area">Step 6: Custom Area Fill</h2>
    <p>
      Our squirrels look so posh in wearing their crowns and ontop of their simple, yet elegant basemap. They deserve better than that garish blue area fill for their respective states. Luckily, it takes just a little extra code to get our map styled. We're going to keep it simple, keeping the fill of the a transparent black and showing where their boundaries would be. 
    <p>
      We've got two steps:
    </p>
    <ol class="lst-lowalph">
      <li>Create style object (styleStates)</li>
      <li>Toss that style object into our call for ssa-states.geojson</li>
    </ol>
